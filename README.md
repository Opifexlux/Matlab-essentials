# Matlab-essentials 

## Summary :dark_sunglasses:
This page will show you some basic code for Matlab. I start off with some really simple math problem-solving and slowly progress on to some more complex problems. 

I will have a PDF :scroll: that will show you some of the tasks and or problems so you can visually see and or try to solve the problem in a different manner. I will also be 
attaching the code ".mlx" file so you can access it and download it. 

If you have any questions please feel free to ask I will try my best to comment on every code so you can understand my thinking process.
